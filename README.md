# Employee Attrition Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the organization using machine learning techniques. It helps the HR department analyze employee behavior and take preventive actions.

The project includes data analysis, visualization, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
